<h1>Yoda Webpage</h1> 

My first webpage built with HTML/CSS/Javascript implementing skills that I have learnt. 

<h2>Why Yoda?</h2>
Programming needs persistence and motivation to keep on going. Skills of Jedi warriors could be very useful 
on a path of learning and becoming better at what we do. Embarking on the programming path can be intimidating as you 
always feel that you don't know enough or what you are doing is not good enough. So we should all channel yedi warriors 
to find the force to keep on going:)
